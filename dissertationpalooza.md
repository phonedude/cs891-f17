# Dissertationpalooza!

All students have been assigned a PhD dissertation from a WSDL alum.  The goals 
of this assignment are to:

* familiarize you with WSDL prior work
* provide an example of successful PhD dissertations

Whereas the original authors had approximately an hour to present their 
research, you will have 20-25 minutes (with questions and discussion,
the enitre presentation should fit with a 30 minute slot).  Since you 
have less than half of the original time, you will need to focus on 
the research questions, technical highlights, and the contributions 
of the dissertation; there will not be time to present the work in its 
entirety.  

Feel free to use figures and tables from the dissertation (be sure to 
mark their number from the original work), but the slides and text 
must be your own work -- not a simplified version of the original
slides.  You're presenting your perspective on their work -- not 
just a karaoke version of the original presentation.

The disserations will be presented in chronological order, with the first 
four presented on November 29 and last four presented on December 6.
